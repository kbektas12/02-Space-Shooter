# Project Name
2D space shooter
  Context and date
    Second Project of MSCH-C220, 9/26/2021
  Description
    My version of the space shooter project with minor implementations
## Implementation
  I added assets to the ships, ship's bullets, enemies and meteors. I also changed the background. Assets were taken from (https://opengameart.org/content/space-shooter-redux) 
  I also added a new enemy with a different look. I did not have the time to implement the interesting concepts I wanted to. I ran into time trouble since I was bad at managing    my time. I was not satisfied with my end product and I feel kind of bad about this. I want to work more on this and make it a cool game.

## Future Development
  I want to make a better version of this game. A real life game reference could be warblade. It includes an upgrade menu, live pickups and enemy types. along with bosses. I will work harder for this class from now and manage my time better. I'm sorry that this was the game I delivered Professor Francis.
